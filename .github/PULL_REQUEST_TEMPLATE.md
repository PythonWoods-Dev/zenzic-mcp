## Type of Change

- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature breaking backward compatibility)
- [ ] Documentation / D.I.A. update
- [ ] Refactoring / Tech Debt removal

## Governance & Compliance Checklist

- [ ] **DCO & Signatures:** All commits are signed with DCO (`git commit -s`) and GPG/SSH (`git commit -S`).
- [ ] **Issue-First:** This PR addresses an explicitly approved Issue.
- [ ] **Changelog:** I have updated `CHANGELOG.md` under the `## [Unreleased]` section.
- [ ] **Commit Standards:** Commit messages strictly follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- [ ] **Absolute Ownership:** I have verified and can architecturally justify every single line of code. No unreviewed AI-generated code is included.

## Architectural Quality Gates (Core Python)

- [ ] **Mirror Law:** I have updated all 10 mandatory targets (including the zenzic init template in templates.py and the VS Code IntelliSense schema in zenzic.schema.json) if adding or modifying a rule.
- [ ] **Local Quality Pipeline:** `just verify` (or `pytest tests/` + `zenzic check all --strict`) passes with 100% test pass rate and no DQS regression.
- [ ] **Zero Subprocess & Determinism:** No unauthorized subprocess executions, shell wrappers, or non-deterministic file I/O are introduced into the core analysis engine.
- [ ] **Custom Rule SDK v3:** If modifying the SDK or rule extensions, changes maintain backward compatibility with `ZenzicRuleV3`.
